                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>
                    StayConnect was inspired by personal experiences with family members who struggled to keep up with rapidly changing technology. 
                    We saw firsthand the challenges they faced and the feelings of isolation that often accompanied their inability to engage fully in the digital world. 
                    This sparked a passion within us to create a solution that would bridge this gap.
                    </p>

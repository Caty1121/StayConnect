                                StayConnect was inspired by our own family members who struggled to keep up with rapidly changing technology. 
                                We saw firsthand the challenges they faced & the feelings of isolation that often accompanied their inability to engage fully in the digital world. 
                                This sparked a passion within us to create a solution that would bridge this gap.                            </p>
